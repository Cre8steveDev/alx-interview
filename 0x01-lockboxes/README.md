# Lockboxes Algorithm

The Lockboxes algorithm is a problem-solving technique that involves unlocking a series of boxes using a set of keys. This algorithm is commonly used in scenarios where access to certain resources or information is restricted.

## Problem Statement

Given a set of lockboxes, each containing a key to another box, the goal is to determine if all the boxes can be opened. The algorithm must check if there is a way to unlock all the boxes by following the keys' sequence.

## Approach

To solve the Lockboxes problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. Starting from an initial box, we explore all possible paths by recursively visiting the boxes that can be unlocked with the available keys. If we can reach all the boxes, the algorithm returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

## Implementation

The Lockboxes algorithm can be implemented in various programming languages. It typically involves representing the lockboxes and keys as data structures, such as arrays or dictionaries, and using recursion or iteration to traverse the boxes and check for unlockability.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the Lockboxes algorithm depends on the number of boxes and keys. In the worst case, where all boxes are locked and the keys are randomly distributed, the algorithm has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the number of boxes.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where N is the number of boxes, as it requires additional space to store the visited boxes and keys.
