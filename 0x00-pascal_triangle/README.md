# Pascal's Triangle

        1
       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1

## My Understanding in writing the algorithm

- The Triangle (rows) is generated by the number given in the function (n)
- The first and last elements in each row is 1
- Elements from arr[1] .... arr[n-2] is the sum of the two numbers above it. I've confused myself. lol.
